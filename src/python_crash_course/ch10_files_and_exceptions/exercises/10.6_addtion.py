# 10-6. Addition:
# One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people provide text instead of numbers.
# When you try to convert the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError.
# Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them together and print the result.
# Catch the ValueError if either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message.
# Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a number.
