# 8-7. Album:
# Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary describing a music album.
# The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of information.
# Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums.
# Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the album information correctly.
# Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of songs on an album.
# If the calling line includes a value for the number of songs, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary.
# Make at least one new function call that includes the number of songs on an album.
