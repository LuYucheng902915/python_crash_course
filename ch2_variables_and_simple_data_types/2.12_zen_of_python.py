# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
# 小彩蛋，当您输入并执行这行代码后，就会显示 "The Zen of Python" 的全部内容。
# 是Python编程语言的核心设计哲学和指导原则的集合。
# 它不是强制的语法规则，而更像是一系列共19条的“箴言”或“警句”，用来引导开发者写出优雅、简洁、易于理解和维护的Python代码。
# 当你听到别人说某种写法“很Pythonic”（很符合Python风格），通常意味着这种写法遵循了“Python之禅”里的原则。

"""
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
