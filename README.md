# Python Crash Course Exercises

This repository contains my personal notes and code exercises for the book "[Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition)" by Eric Matthes.

## About This Project

This project serves as a personal learning log as I work through the foundational concepts and hands-on projects presented in the book. The code is organized into folders that correspond to the book's chapters.

The goal is to practice Python fundamentals and document my progress.

## What I Learned & Practiced

Coming soon.
